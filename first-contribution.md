# Your first contribution

## Find something to work on
 
The first step to getting starting contributing to aelf is to find something to work on. Help is always welcome, and no contribution is too small!

Here are some things you can do today to get started contributing:

- Help improve the aelf documentation

- Clarify code, variables, or functions that can be renamed or commented on

- Write test coverage

## Find a good first topic

There are [multiple repositories](https://github.com/AElfProject) within the aelf organization. Each repository has beginner-friendly issues that are a great place to get started on your contributor journey. Another way to get started is to find a documentation improvement, such as a missing/broken link, which will give you exposure to the code submission/review process without the added complication of technical depth.

## Issue Assignment in Github

When you've found an issue to work on, you can assign it to yourself.

- Reply with /assign or /assign @yourself on the issue you'd like to work on

- Your name will then be listed under, Assignees.

## File an Issue

Not ready to contribute code, but see something that needs work? While the community encourages everyone to contribute code, it is also appreciated when someone reports an issue. Issues should be filed under the appropriate aelf-community subrepository. For example, a documentation issue should be opened in [aelf-community](https://github.com/AElfProject/aelf-community/issues). Make sure to adhere to the prompted submission guidelines while opening an issue.
