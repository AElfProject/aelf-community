# Contributing

aelf is open source, but many of the people working on it do so as their day job. In order to avoid forcing people to be "at work" effectively 24/7, we want to establish some semi-formal protocols around development. Hopefully, these rules make things go more smoothly. If you find that this is not the case, please complain loudly.

As a potential contributor, your changes and ideas are welcome at any hour of the day or night, weekdays, weekends, and holidays. Please do not ever hesitate to ask a question or send a pull request.


## Opening a Pull Request

Pull requests are often called a "PR". aelf generally follows the standard [github pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) process.


## Code Review

For a brief description of the importance of code review, please read On Code Review.
There are two aspects of code review: giving and receiving.

To make it easier for your PR to receive reviews, consider the reviewers will need you to:

- follow the project [coding conventions](https://github.com/AElfProject/AElf/blob/dev/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

- write good commit messages

- break large changes into a logical series of smaller patches which individually make easily understandable changes, and in aggregate solve a broader issue.
