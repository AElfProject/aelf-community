## Developers help

Q:How many Dapps are deployed on testnet now? How do you schedule for launching on the mainnet?

A:There are 5-7 now, actually we are waiting for them to complete the whole contract deployment since we are requiring C# which might need a little more time compared with other blockchain,so after that we can schedule the launching and marketing plan.

Q:Is there any Dapps based on elf chain?

A:Yes, but currently all the dapps are deployed on aelf testnet, once those Dapps pass the test, they will be online.
