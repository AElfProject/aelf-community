## Developers help

Q:How many Dapps are deployed on testnet now? How do you schedule for launching on the mainnet?

A:There are 5-7 now, actually we are waiting for them to complete the whole contract deployment since we are requiring C# which might need a little more time compared with other blockchain,so after that we can schedule the launching and marketing plan.

Q:Is there any Dapps based on elf chain?

A:Yes, but currently all the dapps are deployed on aelf testnet, once those Dapps pass the test, they will be online.


## Address problem

Q: When I doing trasactions and it needs me to input my address, and I saw it sometimes the address is with "_ AELF" at the end , and some times whitout, what is the difference?

A: When you are searching or checking your transactions, it will show your address with "_ AELF" at the end, and when you are using it in transaction, you only need to input your address without "_ AELF".
